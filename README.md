# Innovator-OS
Innovator OS is an AI-powered automation system designed to help learners turn their curiosity into real-world skills, projects, and career opportunities. Rather than simply recommending what to learn, it guides users step by stepâ€”from analyzing a topic idea to identifying the exact tools, programming languages, libraries, and learning resources required. It builds a personalized roadmap that outlines what to learn, where to learn it, how deeply to understand it, and what to build at each stage, from beginner to advanced. The system also assists users in connecting with relevant careers by suggesting search titles, keywords, and strategies to find real-time opportunities and follow the right communities across platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, and others. Built using n8n, OpenAI, and real-time data from search engines and social media platforms, Innovator OS offers a structured, engaging, and practical pathway to continuous learning and innovation.
